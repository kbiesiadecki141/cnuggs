        <h2>Katelyn Biesiadecki</h2>
        <p>Katelyn, also known as “cakepin beaversmecki,” is 
             a first year intended computer science major at 
             University of California, Berkeley, who was involved 
             in robotics in high school but now wallows in a pit of
             nothingness. Her passion for chicken nuggets has 
             hindered her ability to get involved in college 
             extracurriculars to the point where she spends every 
             waking moment coding chickennuggs.com. She plays 
             guitar but isn’t cool, and can also lick her elbow, 
             though she is unwilling to share a live-action video 
             to prove it. Like most depressed college students, 
             she has an undying love for cartoons such as Futurama, 
             Bob’s Burgers, and the Simpsons, though her IQ is 
             unfortunately too low to understand Rick and Morty. 
             Unlike most depressed college students, Katelyn has a 
             shameful aversion to mashed potatoes and bacon that she 
             hides behind a mask of pain and misery. Her favorite jams 
             include your parents’ music, indie, and ???. Her favorite 
             color is fried chicken. She has a blatantly masochistic 
             preference for cats, as she is allergic to them but still 
             prefers them to dogs. She also claims that her only flaw 
             is the fact that she cannot tell the difference between Karen 
             and Jenny -- a sad reality because Karen and Jenny don’t even 
             know each other in real life.

        <h2>Karen Lee</h2>
        <p>Karen, otherwise known as “Squaren Lee” or “yung yeet,” is
             a first year cognitive science major at University of 
             California, Berkeley. Her infatuation with chicken nuggets 
             ignited in high school when she faked a college admission 
             letter to Hamburger University, transcended another plane of 
             reality when she used a chicken nugget as a corsage for prom,
             and culminated in her co-ownership of chickennuggs.com. She 
             is fond of dabbing and whipping and has curated her own dance
             move called the “whab,” which she claims will help her stake 
             a claim during mating season. She enjoys creative writing, 
             crying, exploring the world through spontaneous adventures, 
             sobbing, trivia, wailing in distress, the work of Christopher 
             Nolan, and occasionally whimpering. In the words of her 
             roommate, her music is “utter trash.” She self-identifies as 
             a BAG (basic Asian girl) versus an ABG, and has the tendency 
             to pop Lactaid like ecstasy pills. She is also easily 
             frightened. Unfortunately, she is the progenitor of multiple 
             sons and must pay child support for, among other things, an 
             inflatable Tyrannosaurus Rex and a six foot tall Chinese 
             football player. One of Karen’s visions for the site was 
             for it to be completely in Comic Sans, but Katelyn decided 
             ardently against it. As a creative writer, Karen has explored
             several different genres and avenues of writing; among her best
             (yet underrated) works is the following poem:
        </p>
            <p><b> Cheese Puffs </b><br>
            Cheese puffs are weird <br>
            Cheese puffs are fun <br>
            I like cheese puffs <br>
            But some just suck. </p>

        <h2>Jenny Chau</h2>
        <p>
            Jenny, who is definitely not Karen Lee and does not 
            resemble Karen Lee in any shape or form, is a first 
            year computer science major at University of California, 
            Irvine. She describes herself as an egg -- either 
            hard-boiled, soft-boiled, or raw, depending on her mood 
            -- and is therefore the human embodiment of the Japanese 
            character Gudetama. Her love of chicken nuggets, though 
            undoubtedly true, pales in comparison to her decade-long 
            committed relationship to boba tea. Like any dog lover, 
            her lifelong dream is to fill a mansion with Shiba Inus 
            and live there until she dies. Understandably, she doesn’t 
            know what she’s doing with this site but still thinks it’s 
            awesome.
