# ChickenNuggs.com
## Backstory
chickennuggs.com was created with a vision: expressing love for chicken nuggets. 

Just kidding. It was actually created because one fateful, wintry December day, I wondered to myself: "Does obama.com exist?" Turns out, it does not. And I thought it was strange. 

This led me down a path of asking and answering more questions, like, "Does potato.com exist?" (It is unclear whether or not it does. Go on; try it yourself.) While pursuing this curious adventure, I was messaging my good friend, Karen. Karen and I inexplicably share a love of chicken nuggets, as can be seen by the nugg-related memes we tag each other in frequently. So I decided to look up "chickennuggs.com." 

It was available.

Of course, I wanted to buy the domain. I'm pretty cheap, though, and was _not_ about to spend what could've been up to $35. I mean, I could buy 120 packages of Cup Noodles for $35, which would sustain me roughly a week in Berkeley. 

To my surprise, however, the domain was on some kind of freak deal for $1! I spend more than that on stale granola bars in the vending machine. Plus, Karen was willing to invest with me. We purchased the domain for $1.17, and the rest is history.

## Unfortunate Update
It's been a few years, and GoDaddy wanted us to spend $20 on the website domain. That's too much, man.
